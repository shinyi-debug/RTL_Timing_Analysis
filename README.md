AI-Powered RTL Analysis and Timing Violation Prediction

Overview

This project is an advanced AI-powered RTL analysis tool that extracts circuit information from Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, represents them as a directed graph, and predicts timing violations without requiring full synthesis. By leveraging graph theory, machine learning (ML), and AI, this system helps in early-stage timing analysis and optimization, significantly reducing design iteration time in ASIC/FPGA flows.

Features

RTL Parsing & Netlist Extraction: Converts RTL code into a directed graph representing logic gates and connectivity.

Combinational Depth Analysis: Computes fan-in, fan-out, and critical path depth.

Timing Violation Prediction: Utilizes a Random Forest ML model to predict potential timing violations.

AI-Powered Optimization Insights: Suggests design improvements based on signal complexity.

Graph Visualization: Provides a graphical circuit connectivity view.

Cycle Detection: Identifies combinational loops, preventing synthesis errors.

Technical Details

1. RTL Parsing & Netlist Construction

Regex-based extraction of logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT).

Builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using networkx.

2. Graph Analysis & Signal Complexity Computation

Fan-in & Fan-out calculation for each signal.

Longest path estimation to predict logic depth.

Cycle detection using networkx.find_cycle().

3. Timing Violation Prediction using Machine Learning

Training data: Sample designs labeled with timing violations.

Model: RandomForestClassifier trained on fan-in, fan-out, and depth.

Prediction output: Binary classification (1 = Timing Violation, 0 = No Violation).

4. Visualization & Reporting

Uses matplotlib to render circuit graphs.

Outputs timing violation reports with suggestions.

Installation

pip install networkx matplotlib pandas scikit-learn joblib

Usage

from rtl_analyzer import RTLParser
rtl_code = """ Your RTL Code """
parser = RTLParser(rtl_code)
parser.extract_netlist()
parser.visualize_netlist()
result = parser.analyze_signal("signal_name")
print(result)

Future Enhancements

Integrate LLM-based AI models for advanced circuit insights.

Extend support for multi-clock domain analysis.

Implement automated RTL optimization recommendations based on AI-driven heuristics.

Develop cloud-based API for large-scale RTL verification.
